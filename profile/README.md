Welcome to **EdgeHog** — an open-source **algorithmic trading toolkit** for **TypeScript** developers. Build, backtest, and deploy strategies with **minimal setup**, focusing on your logic while EdgeHog handles the plumbing.  

Designed for developers who want to prioritize **strategy** over infrastructure — with **predictable APIs**, **type safety**, and **zero boilerplate**. Our mission: make algo trading **accessible, reliable, and fun** with modern tools and clean design.

- **Tech stack**: Bun (v1.3+), TypeScript, PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB, CCXT  
- **Exchanges**: Initially Binance and Bybit — with 100 + more via CCXT  
- **Asset classes**: Crypto (spot + perpetual); CFDs and Forex coming soon

EdgeHog is in **early development** — and we’d love your help!
